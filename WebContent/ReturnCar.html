Conditions of Payment
Flexi Tariff
We accept all credit cards from internationally recognised credit card companies - such as American Express, Diners Club, Eurocard/Mastercard, Visa, JCB.
We do not accept any prepaid cards or debit cards (Visa Electron).
Vehicles from the PDMR group and higher as well as Special Cars can only be hired with a credit card accepted by Sixt or a Sixt credit/identification means. All other vehicle groups as well as Convertibles from the MTMR, CTMR and ITMR groups and Offroaders from the SFMR and FFMR groups can also be hiredwith a German girocard. 
Girocards cannot be used to pay for long-term hiring.
Prepaid Tariff
The following credit cards are accepted: Eurocard/Mastercard, AmericanExpress Card, VISA Card, Diners Card and JCB.
We do not accept any prepaid cards or debit cards (Visa Electron).
The renter must be the owner of the indicated credit card. The authorised driver details and method of payment will be confirmed at reservation stage and cannot be amended. The confirmed credit card should be valid and available for presentation on collection of the vehicle. All extra costs that occur during the car rental will be charged to this credit card.
By booking a prepaid rate, the credit card will be charged before the start of rental, directly with the estimated total amount of rental. The amount that will be charged on your credit card comprises the price of the rental as well as all additional extra fees.
The rental charge (plus any other charges agreed, e.g. exemptions from liability, delivery charges, airport charges etc.) plus Value Added Tax in the statutory amount applicable from time to time must, as a matter of principle, be paid in full for the agreed rental period, i.e. if the vehicle is collected late or returned early there shall be no refund.
Generally
A deposit of up to three times the hire price is charged to the chosen means of payment as a security. The deposit for high-value vehicles may differ. The exact deposit is determined on collection since the amount is dependent on the vehicle.

Insurance coverage for the vehicle rented includes Third Party Liability with a maximum cover of EUR 50 Mill for personal injuries and material damages. Maximum cover for personal injuries is EUR 8 Mill per injured person and is limited to Europe only.
